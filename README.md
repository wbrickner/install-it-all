# Install It All

Run `npm install` in many projects at once, with one command.

Very useful for npm organizations.

Installation:

```shell
$ npm install -g @digital-springboard/install-it-all
```
# Usage

`install-it-all` will look for a `manifest.json` file, either at the path provided or in the current directory if no path is provided.

### Example (look in current directory for `manifest.json`)
```shell
$ install-it-all
```

### Example (use provided path)

The argument to IIA is either the path to `manifest.json`, or to a directory containing `manifest.json`.

```shell
$ install-it-all ~/cool-projects/
```

Or you could do:

```shell
$ install-it-all ~/cool-projects/manifest.json
```
## Options

```shell
Usage: install-it-all [path/to/project/manifest.json]

Options:
  -v --version  output the version number
  --no-update   Prevent updating the dependencies (respects semver string)
  --no-dev      Prevent updating / installing dev dependencies
  --only-dev    Only update / install dev dependencies
  -h, --help    output usage information
```


# `manifest.json` Structure

```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "warp-drive",        // optional; auto-discovered if absent
      "description": "It's fast.", // optional; auto-discovered if absent
      "path": "../warp-drive/"     // required; can be absolute or relative to manifest.json
    },
    {
      "path": "../shrink-ray/"     // required; can be absolute or relative to manifest.json
    }
  ]
}
```
